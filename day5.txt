<html>//every html code begins with <html>
	<head>//this is the head of the html code where information about the page can be added
		<title>Daily Code Review</title>// this is where the title of the document is added
	</head>//this is the closing syntax for the head
	<body>//this syntax begins the body of page
		<h1>Cook your food!</h1> //here the header for the page is added
		<form action="http://localhost:8080/cook">//this code allows us to send a request to the address where our code can be hosted; when our code is executed we see the screen shot at that address (http://..,etc)
			<label for="foodName">Food Name:</label>// the for attribute allows us to associate a label with an input
			<input id="foodName" name="foodName" type="text">//this code sets up the inputs we are requesting from the user; in this case: foodName and type
			<br>//this is a break which adds a space
			<button type="submit">Submit</button>//this code allows input from the user to be received 
		</form>//this syntax is for closing out the form
	</body>//this syntax is for osing out the body
</html>//this syntax closes out the html code

public static void main(String[] args) {//every Java program must have this main code line
	Javalin app = Javalin.create();//this code line allows us to create a javalin app
	app.start();//this code allows to start the javaline app

	app.get("cook", ctx -> {//the get method is a handler for requests from the user; the javalin app we created can now receive inputs from the user;the user wants to access the "cook" object; the ctx keyword is used to receive input from user
		String foodSent = ctx.formParam("foodName");//the ctx keyword is accessing the foodName; the data accessed will be saved into the String foodSent

		String cookedFood = "cooked " + foodSent;//this string data type called cookedFood contains the string "cooked", which will be added to data from Foodsent
		ctx.result("Here's your food! <br>" + cookedFood);//the ctx keyword will return the result: "Here is your food! Then a break; plus data from cookedFood
	});//a curly bracket and parenthesis needed here to properly close some codes
}//curly bracket needed here to properly close out the entire code
//this html code is written to allow a user request a food in the html page; the request is captured with the javalin app and processed; based on the user request the corresponding statement will be sent back.  It will look something like this: "Here is your food! cooked rice"
